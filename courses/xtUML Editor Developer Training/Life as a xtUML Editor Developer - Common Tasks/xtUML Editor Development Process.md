The xtUML Editor development team uses a rigorous development process to track changes and share knowledge about proposed changes among the team members.

At a high level, the process is:

  - Create an issue in github Issues
  - Create a branch, named with the issue # & short description
  - Write documents to capture requirements and design.  Analysis, Design, and Implementation note templates are <a href="http://github.com/xtuml/editor/tree/master/doc-editor/process/templates">available here</a>.
  - Review the documents with at least two other team members
  - Implement. Commit descriptions start with github Issues number: ```job #<Issues number> - <description>```
  - Test and Promote
