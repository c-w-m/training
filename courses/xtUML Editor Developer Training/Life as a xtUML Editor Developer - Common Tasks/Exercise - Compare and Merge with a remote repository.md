Let's now take a moment to perform an exercise.

Your task:
  - Set up git remote for Travis London’s repository
  - Compare with the changes Travis made to implement the feature that adds components from an analysis diagram and adds “…” for some shapes.
    - Understand the changes
    - Merge them to a branch in your personal repository
    - Build
    - Run the xtUML Editor Application.  Show successful operation of the new feature.
