Let's now take a moment to perform an exercise.

Your task:
  - Locate where we set the default data type for new attributes in OAL and in Java
  - Change the default type to "string"
  - Build
  - Run the xtUML Editor Application in debug mode.  Show via breakpoint and stepping that the type has successfully changed.
