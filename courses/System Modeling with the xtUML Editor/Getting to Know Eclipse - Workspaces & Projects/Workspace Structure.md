xtUML Editor is built on eclipse.  For any application, it is important to create a meaningful and organized layout of the 
underlying data.  This is especially important when we want to revision control the data in a configuration management
system.  

In this lesson we will discuss the eclipse concepts of "workspaces" and "projects" in detail and cover some important
considerations when using git for revision control.
